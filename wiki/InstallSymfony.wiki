#summary Installation Guide for Users of the MyIsern system.

= Introduction =

This page will tell you how to install the Myisern system on your computer. The orginal system was developed and deployed to Linux. We provide links to help you get setup on other platforms.


= Installing Symfony on Ubuntu =

You must first install PHP 5, Apache/2.2.4, Sqlite (2.8.17) & PHP Pear. Pear is the PHP Extension and Application Repository. You will also need the php-xml and php5-xsl packages.

Installing Symfony on Ubuntu:

The following sequence will enable you to get the system install on Ubuntu Linux:

  # Edit /etc/apt/sources.list with your favorite editor (sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list )
  # add the following line at the end of the file:
     deb http://www.symfony-project.org/get debian/
  # apt-get update
  # apt-get install php5-symfony php-pear php5-mysql
  
   This should install the dependencies for php5-symfony which include php5-cli, php5-common, php-pear, php5-mysql, php5-pgsql.

  If you don't want to install the .deb package, you can install using pear. Follow the [http://www.symfony-project.org/installation Symfony installation instruction] found on the Symfony website.
