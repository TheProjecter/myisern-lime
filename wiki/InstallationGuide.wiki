This page will tell you how to install the myisern system on your computer. The orginal system was deployed to linux however, I will attempt to clarify on how to install on Windows XP and Mac OS.

Requirements:

You must first install PHP 5, Apache/2.2.4, Sqlite (2.8.17) & Php Pear. Pear is the PHP Extension and Application Repository. 

Install symfony.

You must install the symfony pear package on your system. This is documented on the symfony website at http://www.symfony-project.org/installation. If you are not on a Linxu system, we recommend that you install it using the "PEAR installation." If you are on a linux system that includes a package for symfony, we recommend that you use the package. 

The Symfony websites includes on this page http://trac.symfony-project.com/ a description of how to install on Windows and Mac. Please make comments on this page as to your experience.
